  <p>Taken from <a href="https://www.science.org.au/learning/general-audience/science-climate-change/1-what-is-climate-change">
    Science.org</a>: "Climate change is a change in the pattern of weather, and related changes in oceans, land surfaces
    and ice sheets, occurring over time scales of decades or longer".
    Also, according to <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/">The United Nations website</a>:
    "Climate change is affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting
    lives. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and weather events are becoming more extreme". Even
    animal species are dying out, because of the changes on out planet. If we don't, the sea levels will raise,
    entire animal species will die out, the climate will get warmer and more extreme, and it will be irreversible.</p>
  <p>It´s also mostly our fault that this change is happening. Gas and diesel cars, planes, boats, factories etc.
    release, amongst others, loads of CO_2 which is highly dangerous for our climate. Even though we have to stop
    using these types of transportation and creation, we are already way too dependent to "just" stop. Therefore
    people must come together and find alternatives to change our ways of living and using.</p>
