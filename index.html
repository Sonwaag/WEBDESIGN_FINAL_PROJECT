    <h2>Why is fighting climate change such an urgent task?</h2>
    <p>
      According to <a href="https://www.science.org.au/learning/general-audience/science-climate-change/1-what-is-climate-change">
      Science.org</a>: "Climate change is a change in the pattern of weather, and related changes in oceans, land surfaces
      and ice sheets, occurring over time scales of decades or longer".
      <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/">The United Nations</a> also states that:
      "Climate change is affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting
      lives. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and weather events are becoming more extreme". Dozens
        of species all across the globe are on the verge on extinction due to climate change. The sea levels has been
        rising the last decades, and some of the causes are tracked back to greenhouse gases released into our
        atmosphere. Animals becoming extinct is an irreversible incident and we must therefore combat that climate
        change. Setting a steadier course is not impossible and is inevitable for our survival as human beings.
    </p>
    <p>Vehicles powered by fossile fuels are one of the main causes for the release of greenhouse gases. These
        vehicles release tons of carbondioxide into the atmosphere every year, and the forests and other green
        organs are not capable of dealing with all the carbondioxide being released.</p>

    <h2>Our solution.</h2>
    <p>
      According to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/photosynthesis">Britannica.com</a>:
      "Photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into
      chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water,
      carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds."
    </p>
    <img src="images/photosynthesis.jpg" alt="Illustration of photosynthesis">
    <p>
        The photosynthesis, which is being performed in every single living plant, at every given moment of time
        is the main producer of oxygen. And all it takes is carbondioxide, water and solar energy. If we could
        be able to use this power, amplify it inside of a factory and optimize the conversion of carbondioxide
        to oxygen one plant is capable of handling. Our goal is to build such factories across countries, where
        you can deliver the carbondioxide our vehicles are producing.
        But how?

    <h3>The innovation's functionality</h3>
    <!--Made by Sondre Selberg-->
    <video src="images/blender/Mp4Render.mp4" controls>Video of the oxycar contraption</video>
    <p>
        This is where our solution comes into practice. The oxycar is supposed to be a tank, of some kind, which
        is being stabilized on the chassis of the vehicle. The tank will have an input and an output for the
        carbondioxide being collected, where the input transports the carbondioxide from the exhaustpipe of
        the vehicle, into the tank. When the tank is full, the exhaust will be released into the atmosphere
        as usual. Inside the tank, the carbondioxide will be compressed to around its liquid state. This way
        the tank is able to store hundreds of times more carbondioxide, and makes the transportation easier
        too. When the tank is full, you are supposed to deliver the carbondioxide at stations where it is
        being transported to the factories. In return, the owner of the vehicle will be rewarded. Inside the
        factories, there will be layers of moss, and some way to give the moss enough energy to optimize the
        photosyntesis. The moss will then produce oxygen from the carbondioxide and release it back into the
        atmosphere.

    <h2>How does the oxygen car help in the battle against climate change?</h2>
    <p>
        As stated earlier, vehicles powered by fossile fuels release carbondioxide. By storing this gas instead
        of letting it out, the atmosphere will be saved from unnecessary emmisions, and the globe will thrive
        a little more. It is hard to let go of our way of life, using fossile fuel vehicles, so why not make
        them a little more efficient?
