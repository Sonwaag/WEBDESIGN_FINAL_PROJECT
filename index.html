  <h2>Why is it important to "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts"?</h2>
  <img src="images/climateEffect.jpg"
       alt="natural disasters">
  <p>
    Taken from <a href="https://www.science.org.au/learning/general-audience/science-climate-change/1-what-is-climate-change">
    Science.org</a>: "Climate change is a change in the pattern of weather, and related changes in oceans, land surfaces
    and ice sheets, occurring over time scales of decades or longer".
    Also, according to <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/">The United Nations website</a>:
    "Climate change is affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and affecting
    lives. Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and weather events are becoming more extreme". Even
    animal species are dying out, because of the changes on our planet. If we don't, the sea levels will raise,
    entire animal species will die out, the climate will get warmer and more extreme, and it will be irreversible.
  </p>

  <p>
    It´s also mostly our fault that this change is happening. Gas and diesel cars, planes, boats, factories etc.
    release, amongst others, loads of CO_2 which is highly dangerous for our climate. Even though we have to stop
    using these types of transportation and creation, we are already way too dependent to "just" stop. Therefore
    people must come together and find alternatives to change our ways of living and using.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is why we have come up with a possible solution, that might e able to help in the future. Our solution
    can help reduce the emissions, and also uses CO_2 as part of it´s "fuel".
  </p>

  <h2>Our solution.</h2>
  <h3>First, about the photosynthesis.</h3>
  <img src="images/photosynthesis.jpg"
        alt="photosynthesis illustration">
  <p>
    This information is found on <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/photosynthesis">Britannica.com</a>:
    "Photosynthesis, the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into
    chemical energy. During photosynthesis in green plants, light energy is captured and used to convert water,
    carbon dioxide, and minerals into oxygen and energy-rich organic compounds."
  </p>
  <p>
    As we can see, this is also what the image describes. The photosynthesis require, amongst others, carbon dioxide which
    is something we intend to combine with cars emissions.
  </p>
  <h3>The oxygen car.</h3>

  <h2>Why does climate change relate to our solution "..."?</h2>
  <p>
    Fossil fueled cars release huge amounts of carbon dioxide, which damages our planet every single day. This type
    of transportation has become so incredibly important to us, that it would be extremely hard to suddenly stop
    using them.
  </p>
  <p>Not only that, but we need more plants to take in this carbon dioxide, to create more clean air. That´s why
    using green plants and some of the emission from a fossil fueled car will help the environment! This solution
    will of course not solve or stop the global warming, but it will create less emission from some cars. This is the
    way we have chosen to help.</p>
